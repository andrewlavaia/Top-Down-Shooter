Primary Attack - Grab: when next to NPC, can grab them and pick them up if hero strength > npc weight, otherwise can only drag them at half speed. When next to weapon/object, equips weapon/object
Secondary Attack - Spin: Mario 64 spinning for throwing purposes

Lasso:
Primary Attack - Rope'em: throws lasso a distance to try and attempts to attach to any npc or other collidable object
Secondary Attack - Swing/Drag: can swing rope Mario 64 style with npc/object attached if strength is high enough
   
Pole: (or any pole-like object - guitars, sledge hammer, tree branch, sign, etc ) 
Primary Attack - Push: can push npcs quickly with a wide range

Implementation Details
-------------------------
Optional - can make Hero, NPC, and Weapon inherit from a base class:

Movable Entity
	position
	animatedSprite
	directions
	directions_it
	distance_travelled

MapManager class needs to change. Should just load a simple image but will then be populated with a vector of collidable objects.
Types of collidable objects
	SubwayCar - no effect on hero or weapon, but score increases if NPC collides
	ImmovableObject - (ie a pillar) nothing can pass through
	SubwayRail - Hero or NPC die if they touch 
	PlatformEdge - NPCs will not walk over unless they are pushed, thrown, or otherwise forced over

CollidableObject
	position
	sprite (needed for collision detection)
					

Features for future version

- Brainstorm: 300 style speed up and slow time affect
